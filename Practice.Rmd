Latec:
Tranform equations into R readable
inline $ $
Display $$   $$
Example: writing out average of a dataset
$\bar{X} #This gives you an xbar
\sum_{i = 1} ^n #This is the summation par of the mean equation
\frac{x_i}{n} #This is the sample over total part
#In total:
$$\bar{X} = \sum_{i = 1} ^n\frac{x_i}{n}$$


The average pressure for the 'pressure' data frame is `r round(mean(pressure$pressure),2)`mm

The `r calls for this to appear in-line. The round(), 2 shows two decimal places

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = NA) 
#setting global options here
```

Comment = NA removed the harshes in the cars dataset

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r label = "pressure", echo=FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Info for the caption here"}
plot(pressure, col = "blue", pch = 19)
```

#Search for knitr to look at plot setting options like here with fig.width and height. Fig.cap provide captions which give the figure the label, 1.1
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#\begin can only be used in bookdown!
\begin{equation}
\bar{X} = \sum_{i = 1} ^n\frac{x_i}{n}
(\#eq:mean)
\end{equation}

The sample mean is defined in Equation \@ref(eq:mean).

Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:pressure).
